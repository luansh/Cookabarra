# Cookabarra
Cookabarra is a training-target implementation of rv32im cpu, designed to be simple and easy to understand. However, most of the technologies of RISC-V CPU design are still addressed in this practice (named: Kookaburra), including the classic pipeline structure, dealing with data/structure/control hazards, precise exception and interrupt, pipeline stalling and flushing etc. The self-explained Verilog code accompanied with ample comments makes it is easy to expand a variety of new features, for instance, adding i-cache, data-cache units, supporting machine and user privileges as well as applying the branch prediction and etc.    

1. The micro-architecture
  The implementation did not dwell on the micro-architecture design, it has adopted the typical 5 stages pipeline (instruction fetch, instruction decoder, execute, LSU and write back), with the control unit in charge of coordinating all the components as well as handling the exception and interruptions.

2. Test bench
The test bench consists of the CPU core, the data bus as well as some other necessary peripheral devices, including a dual-port RAM (one port for instruction fetching, the other for data access), the simulator ctrl (acting as the console to display the debug information), and a timer to produce interrupts. The bus, simulator ctrl and the timer are from the open-source project ibex provided by lowRISC.

3. verification

3.1 requirements
To run the simulation, the two components (verilator and rv32 gcc toolchain) are necessary, these are accessible from their official website.
  
3.1 Compile the CPU and test bench 

![Alt text](/doc/image/how_to_compile.png?raw=true "makefile")

there is a makefile in the top directory that can be used to build the whole test bench.

3.2 Test
you can run the hellworld test case via the following command:
./tb ./sw_app/c_test/helloworld/helloworld.vmem

3.3 Coremarks
Tested with the coremarks (dowanlaoded from https://github/com/eembc/core-mark.git)
![Alt text](/doc/image/coremarks_output.png?raw=true "makefile")


follow the  command below to run the coremark:
 ./tb ./sw_app/c_test/coremark/core_main.vmem
![Alt text](/doc/image/coremarks_results.png?raw=true "makefile")

 
 coremark/Mhz = 1000*1000000.0/413265041.0 = 2.42

The formula to calculate the coremark/Mhz:

Note: Seen a lot of nop instruction were inserted into the pipeline when there is a branch or jump happened, the performance can be expected to improve significantly by introducing a branch prediction unit.

-------------------------------------------------------------- Added 27-12-2021------------------------------------------------------------------------

The coremarks was boosted by introducing the branch prediction to the implementation. with the following branch prediction parameters:
    parameter RAS_ENTRIES  = 8,
    parameter BTB_ENTRIES  = 64,
    parameter BHT_ENTRIES  = 64
Coremarks was increased from 2.42 to 2.90
